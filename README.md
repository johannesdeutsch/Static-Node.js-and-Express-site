# Project 6 Static Node.js and Express site

This project is a portfolio site that shows examples of code, what've built until now and screenshots how these sites look. It works with back-end technologies like Node.js and Express, and uses Pug for displaying the UI. JSON is used to store all the data of the previous projects, routes have been set up for handling the requests, the middleware handles errors and a server is set up.
