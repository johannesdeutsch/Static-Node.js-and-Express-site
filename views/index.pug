      //- Use the Pug `each` iterator to loop over the projects in your data file  
      each project in projects
        //- Use the example Pug code below and interpolated template literals as needed to dynamically generate:
          //- The paths in the link's href and img's src attributes
          //- The text 'Thumbnail' interpolated with the project title for the img's alt attribute
          //- The project title for the h5 element's text

        .cell
          a(href=`/projects/${project.id}`)
            img.thumbnail(src=`${project.image_urls[0]}`, alt=`${project.description}`)
